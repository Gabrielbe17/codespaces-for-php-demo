Thaler", "description" => "Every day we make choices‚Äîabout what to buy or eat, about financial investments or our children‚Äôs health and education, even about the causes we champion or the planet itself. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible ‚Äúchoice architecture‚Äù to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice."],

The stories originally appeared in science-fiction magazines between 1940 and 1950, the year that they were first published together in book form.
